#this file will have the same structure as A.html, C.html, G.html, T.html but the particular information (p.e. chemical formula) will be turned into variables (by enclosing them into double braces "{{}}") , in order to change the static webpage into a dynamic one
#this file is just a long str in which we've to substitute the values for the created variables. Those values will be found in the server2 (BASES INFORMATION), i.e. we create a database (dictionary)
